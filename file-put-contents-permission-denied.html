file_put_contents() permission denied

1) If you take a look at your cache.php config file you'll see that for the file driver the storage/framework/cache/data folder is set for writing:

'file' => [
    'driver' => 'file',
    'path' => storage_path('framework/cache/data'),
],

That means that the permissions for that folder must be properly set so that the web server user can successfully write to that folder.

2) or you can just running this command for me it solved my problem

php artisan cache:clear 
chmod -R 775 storage/
composer dump-autoload

3) The stream or file "/storage/logs/laravel.log" could not be opened in append mode: failed to open stream: Permission denied

sudo chmod -R ugo+rw storage
